# Plant-monitoring-website-intelligrow
It is a full stack website of plant monitoring in which, I use HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSP, Java-Servlets, and MySQL.
Currently, this project is working on the local host which we can further host by using some platform.
The idea behind making this website is to help people to grow their plants healthy and make longer plant lives. Our system will give dates for watering the particular plant. Further it can send mails or alert for water, fertilizers, etc.
I use html, css, and javascript for the front end and jsp, java-servlet, and MySql for the back end.
You can get various files in their respective folder.
For MySQL files, I share a dumb file in which you can change the username and password according to your SQL.
I learned too much by working on this.
Thank you.
